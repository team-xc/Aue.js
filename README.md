# Aue.js
Aue is a js framework!

Every Aue application starts by creating a new Aue instance with the Aue function:
``` js
var am = new Aue({
  // options
})
```

The most basic form of data binding is text interpolation using the “Mustache” syntax (double curly braces):
``` html
<span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>
```
